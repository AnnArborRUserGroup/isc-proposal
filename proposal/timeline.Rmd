# Project plan

## Start-up phase

<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.


 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->

A GitHub repository will be set up for us to collaboratively work on documents
summarising our evaluation of the different systems.

## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->

### Evaluation Stage (Mid March - End April)

We will work through each CMS in turn, with the proposers performing the 
following roles

 - Steph Locke: Set up test system, if time allows consider general issues such 
 as security, accessibility, ability to set up recurring events (1 week/CMS)
 - Heather Turner, Julie Josse, Torben Tvedebrink, Torsten Hothorn, 
 Achim Zeileis: Rotate through the following roles and collaboratively edit
 document on pros/cons of system (2 hours/CMS)
    - Participant 1: submit abstract, edit abstract, contact local organizer
    - Participant 2: submit abstract, register (no payment - or pay nominal 
    amount and refund?)
    - Program chair: assign abstracts to reviewers, make final decision, 
    schedule presentations, assign chairs
    - Reviewer 1: ask for first abstract to be reassigned (to Reviewer 2), 
    review second abstract, make recommendation
    - Reviewer 2: review first abstract, make recommendation, suggest session 
    for abstract, see if there is a way to group with second abstract
    - Local organizer - email registered participants, add information to the
    conference website
    
While the other members are evaluating the last CMS, Steph will round up the 
pros/cons of each CMS, make further tests as requested by the team and consider
additional pros/cons not explicitly tested by the above (1 week).

At the end of this stage the team will meet to discuss the pros and cons and 
make a decision on which CMS to take forward (2hrs).

An additional week of Steff's time is allowed to handle any further queries 
required to make a final decision.

[Gantt chart here: Steph 6 weeks full time, others 2 hours/week]

### Development Stage (May - June)

Hacing decided on a CMS, Steph will work on putting the system into production,
ready for use by useR! 2018 and the next satRdays. This will include creating 
standard text where possible e.g. for abstract submission instructions, and 
creating templates that reuse parameters, e.g. abstract submission deadlines 
(2 weeks).

Given previous experience of testing each CMS, the team will decide how best to 
test the system. A certain amount of testing will be done by each team member
(8 hrs each). Members of the community may be invited to comment on the website 
and to test the system, in particular this may be necessary to fully test 
accessibility for the visually impaired.

Steph will make adjustments in response to the testing (1 week). Larger changes
- requiring extensions to the system itself - may need to be addressed in a 
separate project.

### Production Stage (July - )

Steph will work with the organisers of useR! 2018 and the next satRdays to 
provide support in using the new system and make any necessary adjustments 
(2 weeks).
